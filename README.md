## My Neovim Config

![Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 22 51 02](https://github.com/ororsatti/nvim-configuration-files/assets/109456266/0650a4cf-db3a-44b2-966c-fb3f4d19f3fa)

It's a pretty simple config, basically a copy of Kickstart.nvim, with some tweaks.

On top of Kickstart's plugins it has:
- leap.nvim
- copilot.nvim
- nullls.nvim (RIP)
- undotree.vim
- harpoon

Also it's fully transparent.
Its sealed for now, I don't think I will reconfigure any time soon.
